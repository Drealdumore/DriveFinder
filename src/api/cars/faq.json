    "question": "What payment methods does DriveFinder accept?",
    "answer": "DriveFinder accepts most credit cards issued by major financial institutions, including American Express and Discover cards, as well as debit cards with a Visa or Mastercard logo that are linked to a checking account. Apple Pay and Google Pay on mobile devices are also accepted, but DriveFinder does not accept cash or checks as valid payment methods."

  {
    "question": "Can other people drive a car that I booked?",
    "answer": "Yes, multiple guests can drive the car you book on DriveFinder, as long as they are all approved to drive. The primary driver (whoever booked the car) can add additional drivers with no fees or additional charges. Only the primary driver can request to add drivers; DriveFinder hosts cannot do it for you. We encourage you to request to add additional drivers before your trip starts, though guests in the US and Canada can request to add a driver while a trip is in progress. To speed up the process, have your additional driver create a DriveFinder account and get approved to drive before you request to add them. All drivers must have a valid driver’s license and meet the age requirements for the car you’ve booked. You can request to add drivers via the “Trips” tab in the DriveFinder app without additional driver charges or extra costs."

    "question": "What is the cancellation policy on DriveFinder?",
    "answer": "You can cancel and get a full refund up to 24 hours before your trip starts. If you book a trip with less than 24 hours’ notice, you have one hour after booking to cancel free of charge. If you cancel after the free cancellation period ends, you will be charged a small cancellation fee. In the rare event a host cancels, you’ll be notified immediately so you can book another car, or we’ll help you find one. Your refund can be temporarily held to expedite rebooking, or the funds can be returned to your bank account — your choice."

    "question": "What happens if I have an accident?",
    "answer": "If there’s an emergency or an issue with the car, call our emergency roadside assistance provider, available 24/7. We’ll make sure you’re safe, then help you get back on your way."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I get my car delivered to me?",
    "answer": "Yes, many hosts offer delivery to travel hubs like airports, train stations, and hotels, or to custom delivery locations. There are cars available on DriveFinder at convenient locations near hundreds of airports. Skip the rental counter and have your car delivered for pickup and return at your hotel or vacation rental, or nearby location, to save time and hassle on your weekend getaway or family vacation. Some hosts offer free delivery, while others set their own delivery fee."

  {
    "question": "How do I get discounts when booking a car?",
    "answer": "On your Account page, make sure you’ve checked the box to receive email notifications, and enable push notifications from the DriveFinder app in your phone settings — we’ll send you occasional promotions, discounts, and deals! Additionally, frequent travelers in the United States can get rewarded with the loyalty bonus — earn a promo code for one bonus day when you take trips totaling 10 days in a 90-day period!"
