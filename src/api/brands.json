BMW offers a comprehensive vehicle selection across nearly every segment, from luxury SUVs, to hatchbacks, to sports cars, and even electric models in the i4, iX, and more. BMW started out producing aircraft engines, hence the stylized propeller logo. Now a staple vehicle manufacturer around the world, BMW’s bread and butter compared to the other German brands is their sports cars, particularly from BMW’s M division. The M2, M3, M4, and M5 are well-known for offering an impressive balance of usability and hard-nosed performance. These elite vehicles prioritize powerful engines and finely tuned suspensions to offer roaring on-road performance, in fitting with BMW’s slogans of “the ultimate driving machine” and “sheer driving pleasure.”"

        "answer": "Yes! If you would like to extend your trip please modify your trip in the DriveFinder app and we will approve it right away."

      {
        "question": "Is there a fee to add additional drivers to my trip?",
        "answer": "There is no fee or additional charge for adding a driver to your trip on DriveFinder. Only the guest who booked the trip (primary driver) can request to add drivers; DriveFinder hosts cannot do it for you. We encourage you to request to add authorized drivers before your trip starts, though guests in the US and Canada can request to add a driver while a trip is in progress with no extra charges."
      },

      {
        "question": "Are there discounts on weekly or monthly trips?",
        "answer": "Yes, many DriveFinder hosts offer discounted prices when you book trips lasting 3+, 7+, or 30+ days. Additionally, hosts can offer “early bird” discounts for trips booked a week or more in advance. So, get the best deals and lowest rates possible by booking longer trips, at least a week in advance."
